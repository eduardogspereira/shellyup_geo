$ yum install httpd
|
|-> Install Apache HTTP Service 2.2.

$ chkconfig httpd on
|
|-> This will set Apache to always start with the server.

$ chkconfig --list httpd
|
|-> Check if this is set right. The output show be like this:
    "httpd            0:off 1:off 2:on  3:on  4:on  5:on  6:off"

$ iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
$ /etc/init.d/iptables save
$ /etc/init.d/iptables restart 
|
|-> Allows to receive connection on Apache port.

$ rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-6.noarch.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh https://mirror.webtatic.com/yum/el6/latest.rpm
|
|-> Repositories to install PHP5.6.

$ yum update -y
|
|-> Update the packages.

$ yum install php56w php56w-opcache php56w-pgsql
|
|-> Install PHP packages.


$ vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
|
|-> Change this lines:

-On line 809 add this:
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .html

-On line 816 add this:
AddType text/html .shtml .php

-On line 817 add this:
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

-On line 331 replace with this:
Options FollowSymLinks


$ /etc/init.d/httpd restart
|
|-> Restart to reload the settings.

$ cp info.html /var/www/html/
|
|-> Testing with PHP is working fine. On the browser type the server IP with '/info.html'. You should see a page with PHP informations. 
  http://<IP>/info.html

$ setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1
|
|-> By default the CentOS don't allow the Apache to connect direct with the database. So we need to change this variable on the CentOS by running this command.

$ getsebool httpd_can_network_connect_db
|
|-> After you can run this command to see if it worked. It must be showing 'on'.

// Now go on your browser again on http://<IP>/info.html and check if the message changed from "Can't connect with the database" to "Successfully connected to database". If it's working fine, go to the next step.

// When we did the install (12.29.2016), your SELinux was disabled. That's ok, it's probably disabled because you hosting company have other ways to ensure the centos security. But if on the future you turn on the SELinux (set it to enforcing), you will notice that the Apache+PHP won't be able to connect with PostgreSQL. The SELinux isolate the processes that are running on the system, so if one hack into your system he won't be able attack both apache and postgresql. So, to resolve this problem you must run the commands from line 67 and line 71.

$ rm -f /var/www/html/info.html
|
|-> Remove this file, we won't need it anymore.

$ yum install python34 -y
|
|-> Let's install Python 3.4.

$ yum install python34-setuptools
$ easy_install-3.4 pip
$ pip3 install geocoder
|
|-> Install Geocoder. This will be the only Python we will be using. 

$ cp html.tar.gz /var/www/html/
$ cd /var/www/html/
$ tar xvf html.tar.gz
$ rm html.tar.gz
|
|-> Extract the files.

// Now the app would be working on http://<IP>/
